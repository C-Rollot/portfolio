# Welcome on my portfolio repository

Hi! For this portfolio, I used React, and I wanted and old-school Windows95 style, so I used React95, which is a React components library that provides various and very accurate Windows 95 elements.

## What I used

- React
- React Router
- Vite
- React95 library
